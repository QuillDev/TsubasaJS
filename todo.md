# Features

* Add a majority vote system
* Override these limitations if you're admin (have manage channels perm)
## New Commands
* t>shuffle - shuffles queue
* t>master - shows the current owner of the player
## Possibilities
### TsubasaLink
Write my own music streaming node system like Lavalink, Lavalink library has some issues with it that I don't exactly love - TsubasaLink? - Maybe just fork LavaLink and update some stuff? Shoukaku should still be able to connect! If not write a custom solution for that too?
