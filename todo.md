# TODO List for things to change/features to add.

## New Commands
### t>doujin [?QUERY]
Gets a random doujin if there's no args, gets a popular one matching the query otherwise

### t>doujintop
Gets the popular doujins off nhentai right now


## Possibilities
### TsubasaLink
Write my own music streaming node system like Lavalink, Lavalink library has some issues with it that I don't exactly love - TsubasaLink? - Maybe just fork LavaLink and update some stuff? Shoukaku should still be able to connect! If not write a custom solution for that too?
